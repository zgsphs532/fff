# PhoenixMiner - 5.5c - AMD+NVIDIA GPU Miner 

 ![scredffe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82437867/114514871-f1f61b80-9c65-11eb-8932-cd9a205c344d.png)

The miner will start, run the setx commands to set those environment variables, initialize each of your GPU’s, build the DAG file on each of your GPU’s and start hashing away. Let it run for about 20 seconds and then click “s” to display your Hashing speed.

## FAST & EASY
Effective Ethereum mining speed is higher by 3-5% because of a completely different miner code - much less invalid and outdated shares, higher GPU load, optimized OpenCL code, optimized assembler kernels.

## WORKS ON ALL DEVICES
Supports both AMD and nVidia cards (including in mixed mining rigs). It runs under Windows x64 and Linux x64.

## STABILITY & RELIABILITY

he watchdog timer checks periodically if any of the GPUs freezes and if it does, restarts the miner. Supports memory straps for AMD/NVIDIA cards. Use the -straps command-line option to activate it.
